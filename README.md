# docker-reddit-stats
Docker + pup + Influxdb + Grafana to graph reddit user stats

Dummy project to play with a few technologies and finaly get a nice graph of the number of user logged in and viewing a subreddit.
Goals:
- learn a bit of:
  - docker
  - go (and pup)
  - influxdb
  - Grafana
  - git
- and share this experience if this can be useful for someone else.

Disclaimer: I'm not a developper and don't intend to be one! Please bear with me.
